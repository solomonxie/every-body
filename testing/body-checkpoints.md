ID: `heritage.sex.age.clothing.shape.view.pose`, e.g. `east-asian.female.adult.bare.XXL-XXL.top-down.back-60`

## What to look for

- skin: facets, lumps, creases, folds, self-intersection, seams
- colour: blotches, bands, streaks, sallow/grey tone, face vs body mismatch
- shape: silhouette corners, proportions, symmetry, face prettiness (esp. profile)
- joints: limbs detaching, candy-wrapper twist, skin pinching, internals poking out
- garments, hair, eyes, lashes: gaps, clipping, floating

## Pick order

1. User-reported cells (below), until signed off on device
2. Extremes: XXL-XXL, pregnant, senior, infant; max bends; top-down / low-up
3. Random `--sample` per heritage, rotating

Render: app renderer `scripts/render_body/render.sh` (needs Mac unlocked), else headless Blender with the app's lights.
